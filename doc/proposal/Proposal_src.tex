\begin{abstract}
Convolution is a fundamental and computationally intensive operation widely used in computer vision and image processing. This project investigates the performance limitations of sequential convolution implementations and explores acceleration using multi-core CPU architectures. We employ profiling techniques to identify bottlenecks, apply OpenMP directives to parallelize the core convolution loops, and conduct a systematic evaluation of the resulting speedup and scalability. The objective is to demonstrate significant performance improvements achievable through standard parallel programming techniques for this common computational kernel, contextualized within the principles of automatic parallelization analysis.

\section{Introduction}
\textit{{\color{blue} % Optional color for visibility
[Convolution is a foundational operation in image processing and computer vision, widely used for tasks such as edge detection, blurring, and feature extraction. It's also a core component in many deep learning architectures. 
Despite its ubiquity, convolution is known to be computationally intensive, particularly when applied to large images or multi-channel data. 
Sequential implementations of convolution often underutilize the modern multi-core CPU architectures, leading to suboptimal performance and increased processing time.
Automatic parallelization offers a promising approach to address these performance limitations by transforming sequential code into parallel code with minimal programmer intervention 
This process involves analyzing the code to identify opportunities for parallelism, dividing computations into parallel tasks, and coordinating their execution to maximize hardware utilization. 
However, automatic parallelization presents challenges such as managing data dependencies, balancing workload distribution, and minimizing communication overhead, especially for operations like convolution that rely on local neighborhoods in the input data.
This research project focuses on analyzing and parallelizing image convolution kernels to demonstrate the potential of automatic parallelization techniques. 
Specifically, we aim to investigate the performance limitations of sequential convolution implementations and explore acceleration using OpenMP, 
a widely used framework for shared-memory parallel programming. By profiling the sequential code to identify bottlenecks and applying OpenMP directives to parallelize the core convolution loops, 
we aim to achieve significant performance improvements. The project will also evaluate the scalability and efficiency of the parallel implementation, providing insights into the practical benefits and challenges of parallelizing computationally intensive kernels.
Through this work, we aim to highlight the importance of mastering parallel programming paradigms and tools, 
such as OpenMP, to efficiently solve real-world computational problems. 
The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic parallelization and its application to high-performance computing tasks in image processing.
