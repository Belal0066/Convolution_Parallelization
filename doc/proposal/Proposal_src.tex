\begin{abstract}
Convolution is a fundamental and computationally intensive operation widely used in computer vision and image processing. This project investigates the performance limitations of sequential convolution implementations and explores acceleration using multi-core CPU architectures. We employ profiling techniques to identify bottlenecks, apply OpenMP directives to parallelize the core convolution loops, and conduct a systematic evaluation of the resulting speedup and scalability. The objective is to demonstrate significant performance improvements achievable through standard parallel programming techniques for this common computational kernel, contextualized within the principles of automatic parallelization analysis.

\section{Introduction}
\textit{{\color{blue} % Optional color for visibility
[Convolution is a cornerstone operation in image processing and computer vision, serving as the computational backbone for tasks such as edge detection, blurring, sharpening, and more recently, deep learning. Due to its high arithmetic intensity and repetitive nature, convolution is computationally expensive, especially when applied to large images or performed across multiple kernels. In modern systems equipped with multi-core CPUs, relying solely on sequential execution leads to inefficient resource utilization and prolonged processing times. These inefficiencies become especially apparent in real-time or large-scale applications, where rapid processing of high-resolution images is critical.

Automatic parallelization offers a compelling solution to this problem by transforming inherently sequential code into parallel code that can fully leverage the capabilities of modern hardware. However, automatic parallelization of convolution operations poses several challenges, including data dependencies between neighboring pixels, memory access patterns, and the need to minimize synchronization overhead. These challenges demand careful analysis of the computational structure and a deliberate application of parallel constructs to avoid incorrect results or performance degradation.

Previous research has explored the parallelization of convolution using a variety of tools and techniques. For example, studies have demonstrated the use of OpenMP directives to parallelize convolution loops with significant performance improvements \cite{}. Others have investigated GPU acceleration or the use of vectorized instructions. Nonetheless, there remains an ongoing need for practical, CPU-focused implementations that bridge the gap between theoretical speedup potential and real-world application performance.

In this project, we aim to analyze and parallelize a sequential image convolution implementation using OpenMP on a multi-core CPU architecture. We begin by profiling the original code to identify computational bottlenecks and parallelization opportunities. We then apply loop-level OpenMP directives to parallelize the core convolution operations. Finally, we evaluate the performance improvements achieved in terms of speedup and scalability. This work contributes to the broader understanding of how standard parallel programming techniques can be systematically applied to optimize a fundamental image processing kernel and provides insight into the practical application of automatic parallelization principles.]
